# BibleExploration
This project is to explore the use of data to determine different usages of words and phrases in the Bible. (Fore example, we can visualize what words are used the most often, or query the number of times a certain word or phrase is used.)
The main file is an jupyter notebook, so anyone interested can download the file and follow along! Feel free to make changes and explore your own interests!
